\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

This document is a collection of notes on category theory that I took as I was learning it. My goal is to have somewhere I can write the things that I've learned so I can refer to them later, with the added benefit that someone else may find this useful as well.

I keep it up to date for another reason: I think that there's some pedagogical value in the writings of beginners. The proofs included here are not here because they're the most elegant or the cleanest; instead, they're here because they're the proofs that finally made me, a novice struggling with category theory for the first time, understand the material.

However, things written by beginners come with an obvious caveat: there are undoubtedly many mistakes.
